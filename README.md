Bitcoin on-chain metrics provide a view into the underlying mechanics of the Bitcoin network and protocol. From that view predictions can be made about what's going to happen at the economic market level. These are not perfect extractions, it is odds based. 

The value to traders and investors can immense if they can get an edge and predict what is going to happen within some level of certainty. 

At a high level this is the value proposition and the primary economic driver for building the ClarionChain system. 

A subset of ClarionChain is ClarionPool. This focuses on Bitcoin's mempool rather than focusing on confirmed blocks. In general "Bitcoin on-chain analytics" referrs to looking at confirmed blocks and few instances of meaningful metrics looking at the mempool. 

ClarionPool is intelligently examining all transactions and their attributes in the mempool at a high frequency. Something on the order of extracting data and compiling a new version of each metric every 60 seconds for example. 

Every 60 seconds ClarionPool provides a "predictive" view into block metrics. ClarionPool will produce with a high level of accuracy block stats before the block is confirmed, before it actually "happens". 

Bitcoin blocks are confirmed on average every 10 minutes. This is the maximum granularity at which block statistics can be viewed. If threshold alerts are set to inform a user of one or a group of on-chain metrics have triggered a threshold that suggests some action should be taken that is valuable because you are learning about it exactly when it occurs as part of a block confirmation. 

If ClarionPool can alert you before the block is confirmed because the ClarionPool prediction model says there is a 90% change this group of transations will be confirmed in the next block, and when they are confirmed it changes this list of on-chain metrics in this way, and here are the ones that will exceed the threshhold that is more valuable and gives an edge over others who are waiting for block confirmations. 

An example could be transactions that are in profit or loss, or percent of the supply in profit or loss. There are many metrics that measure profit and loss in different ways for each block confirmation. If ClarionPool can tell you that say 80% of the transactions in the mempool are at a loss this might mean there is a sell off about to happen and there is more fear in the market. The age of the coins in the TXs also tell who is selling, long term holders or short term holders. Short term holders usually are fearful and sell easily and often at a loss, long term held coins who are selling tell you it's a different cohort. Differnt valuable insights can be gained by knowing who is selling, is it at a profit or loss and what percentage of the mempool TXs fall into each of these profiles.

If this can be learned before block confirmations by looking at the mempool it is an edge allowing one to act before those transactions are confirmed and finalized. 

We can even imagine a fear and greed index metric based on the mempool alone. In other words does the aggregate state of the mempool suggest fear or greed right now, what pecent of TX are losses, which are in profit, etc.
